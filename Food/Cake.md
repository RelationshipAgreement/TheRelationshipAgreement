<h2>Article 1 of 1</h2><br><h4>Summary:Bae is always required to share cake with the other bae.</h4> 
Bae is always required to share cake with the other bae. If such a situation arises where cake is limited or bae is not available or one of the baes is surrounded with too many people, then eating the cake alone will be termed as a clear breach of the relationship agreement. The bae who eats cake alone is henceforth known as the criminal bae while the bae who was devoid of cake will be known as the victim bae. If the above event happens more than twice, the relationship terminates immediately. This termination of relationship, however, is recoverable. To continue the relationship, criminal bae is required to either take victim bae and get a pastry or equivalent as soon as possible.
